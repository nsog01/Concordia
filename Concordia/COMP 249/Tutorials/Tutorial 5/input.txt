Though modeling and verifying Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) 
have long been under study,there are still challenges when 
many different aspects need to be considered simultaneously. 
In fact, various frameworks have been carried out for modeling 
and verifying MASs with respect to knowledge and social commitments 
independently. However, considering them under the same framework
still needs further investigation, particularly from the verification
perspective. In this article, we present a new technique for model 
checking the logic of knowledge and commitments.
