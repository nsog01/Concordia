calculatePositions:

- ct_nest;Maximum number of control structure nested levels in a function.

- ct_vg;Cyclomatic number of the control graph of the function
In the graph theory the Cyclomatic number V(g) gives the number of linearly
independent paths in a connected graph. 

- lc_stat;Number of executable statements in the function.

- n2;Number of different operands used in the function.

getErrorAtOffset:


- n2;Number of different operands used in the function.
- lc_stat;Number of executable statements in the function.
- ct_vg;Cyclomatic number of the control graph of the function
In the graph theory the Cyclomatic number V(g) gives the number of linearly
independent paths in a connected graph. 
- ct_npath; Number of non-cyclic execution paths.
It is calculated according to the transfers of control induced by the various
types of statement. The PATH for a sequence of statements with the same nesting
level is the product of each statement's PATH. For nested structures the
sum of the PATH is calculated.
Therefore:
	PATH (if then else endif) = PATH (body of then) + PATH (body of else)
	PATH (while do - endwhile) = PATH (body of while) + 1
	PATH (case of - endcase) = SUM(i=1n) PATH (body of ist case)
where n is the number of cases.
	PATH (sequence) = 1
