# Concordia
Everything from my undergrad at Concordia is in this repo.
I want people to fork and contribute to this repo and have this as an organically evolving open source root for academic resources for anyone willing to learn.

## Setting up
Initially, you will need to install git.
Then, to download the content of this repository you must type `git clone https://github.com/jhubscher/Concordia.git` or `git@github.com:jhubscher/Concordia.git` into your terminal.

## Contributing
If you have updated or new resources that you'd like to add to the repo, you will need to install git and git-lfs.
Then you must register for a Github account and setup your SSH key with your Github account.
Once you are done setting up, you must first fork the repo to your account.
After forking the repo, clone the forked copy of the repo to your local machine.
Once cloned, type `git lfs install` into your terminal.

*If you are adding files larger than 1 MB, add the file extension to git lfs with the command `git lfs track *.file-extension`
